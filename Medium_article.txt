<center>**Just Do It!**<center>
===============================

>I believe I am not the first and definitely not the last person who happened to be in the situation when in my mid 20's I realized what I had been doing for the last 3 years after university graduation was not my cup of tea and did not give me satisfaction any more. I felt I was going the wrong way and I had to make some radical changes in my life. It took me a few weeks of sleepless nights to put myself together and eventually make the decision!

>I quit my job, left my comfort zone and started everything clean slate. I must admit that the feeling I had at that time was not just excitement and anticipation of something great coming, but also a fear to make a mistake. But **I JUST DID IT**! I took a step forward and got ready to conquer the world!

>Here I am … an Access Code fellow student being honoured to join Coalition for Queens community and to be surrounded by talented people united by the same goal and passion — programming!

>A week ago Access Code students were lucky to meet *Paola Maldonado*, Access Code graduate, and *Kevin Galligan*, the CEO of Touch Lab — great people who proved to me one more time that passion and drive along with perseverance and hard work are guarantees to success. They had a different life story and experience, different obstacles to overcome, but they had one very important thing in common — **love towards programming** — that helped them get to the top of their career ladder.

>Such people deserve to be admired and serve as a source of inspiration for others. When I decided to change my career life I felt I was doing the right thing, now I **KNOW** it and **JUST DO IT**!
