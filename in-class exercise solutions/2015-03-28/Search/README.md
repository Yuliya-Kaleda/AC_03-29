Given a dictionary, implement some basic search functions

copy /usr/share/dict/words
one word per line

Create a dictionary class with a constructor that takes it a file name
Load all words into an ArrayList

Implement a method “search” that accepts a search term from user input and returns all “hits”, in other words, words that contain the search term

Implement a method “prefixSearch” that only returns “hits” that START with the search term

Implement a method “suffixSearch” that only returns “hits” that END with the search term

Be sure to account for the cases where there are no hits!


EXTRA CREDIT: 
load the dictionary from a URL instead of a local file using:
