Create two classes BankAccount and Patron<br>
A BankAccount has a balance<br>
A Patron has a name, an account, and his/her “pocket”.<br>
<br>
For now, our constraints will be:<br>
1) a patron can only interact with one account (1 => 1)<br>
2) an account can interact with many patrons (1 => many)<br>
3) we will deal with dollars ONLY, not cents<br>
<br>
Create a program that creates objects of these types and have them interact with each other.<br>
<br>
Some suggested “interactions”:<br>
1) an account should allow withdrawals and deposits<br>
2) a patron can get from and put money in the account<br>
3) both should be able to show their current “balance”<br>
<br>
Extra credit:<br>
Make it so a patron can interact with multiple accounts<br>
You will have to update your methods in Patron in order to specify the account with which you’re interacting.<br>
