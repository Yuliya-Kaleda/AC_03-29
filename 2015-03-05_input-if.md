Input
=

Previously, we learned how to print. Remember the syntax?

    System.out.println("I am printing a line!");

But just printing gets a bit boring. Today, we're going to learn how to ask the user for feedback. In programming, we call this *reading user input*. Let's talk about how.

**Scanner**

In Java, a simple program that reads user input looks like this:

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Echo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Say something:");
            String something = input.next();
            System.out.println(something);
        }
    }

First, we *import the `Scanner`*, meaning we tell the Java compiler to include some code written by another developer. Then to create a new `Scanner`, we type:

    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

Don't worry if you don't know exactly what this does. Think of this like driving: you don't need to know how a car engine works in order to drive a car. In programming, we call this *abstraction*. We don't care *how* the `Scanner` works, but we know what it *does*. What can you do with a `Scanner`?

**Functions**

The `Scanner` gives you the programmer some magical powers called *functions*. A function, like the gas and break pedals on a car, allows you to interact with the `Scanner`. For example, we can ask the `Scanner` to ask the user for an `int` like this:

    int usersAge = input.nextInt();

[This page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) has a full list of `Scanner` functions. 

Let's go through the first exercise together.

> **Exercise:** [Asking Questions](http://programmingbydoing.com/a/asking-questions.html)

Now try to use the `Scanner` yourself, but first...

**Ground Rules for Exercises**

- Don't just copy and paste! Programming, like playing an instrument or speaking another language, requires muscle memory. It is important that you get used to *typing* Java for yourself. Also, you will notice things you would not otherwise if you are forced to type them.
- At the top of every exercise, write a *document comment*. A document comment is description of the program for another user (or your future self). Get used to documenting your work! Here is an example document comment for the previous exercise:

```
    /**
     * Access Code 2.1
     * Gregory Gundersen
     * AskingQuestions.java
     * This class prompts the user for some personal data and then repeats it back to them.
     */
```

- After every exercise, commit your work to GitHub!

> - What happens if you don't prompt the user for input but still run the program?

If-then statement
=
Ultimately, we want to write our own calculator! But first we need to respond to user input. In Java, we can do this with the *if statement*. The `if` statement is a *control structure*. If programming is driving, then control structures are steering wheels. They allow you to control how the program will execute. Let's look at an example:

    if (7 > 3) {
        System.out.println("7 is greater than 3");
    }

In the above code, we tell the program to print some text if the expression in parentheses is `true`. Remember the `boolean` type? Review the previous lecture for the operations that create booleans by comparing types.

**Syntax**
- "if" is lowercase
- "if" is followed by parentheses
- The value inside the parentheses is a `boolean` but it can be created using the boolean operators.

Let's do a simple exercise together:
> **Exercise:** [What if](http://programmingbydoing.com/a/what-if.html)

Now you try. Remember to type them yourself, leave comments, and commit your work!
> **Exercise:** [How Old Are You?](http://programmingbydoing.com/a/how-old-are-you.html)

If-then-else
=

`if` can be followed by `else`, indicating that the block of code inside the `else` only execute if the original condition is false. Here is an example:

    if (7 > 3) {
        System.out.println("7 is greater than 3");
    } else {
        System.out.println("or we're in big trouble!");
    }

> **Exercise:** [A little quiz](http://programmingbydoing.com/a/a-little-quiz.html)
- Come up with your own questions and answers
- How can you keep track of the number of correct and incorrect answers?

In-class homework
==

Write a [Reverse Polish notation calculator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)! Reverse Polish notation is a mathematical notation where the operator comes after the two operands, like this `2 3 +`, which evaluates to `5`. Your task is to write a class `RPNCalculator` that prompts the user for two numbers and a mathmetical operator and then returns the correct result. Here is an example:

    "Please enter your first number"
    3
    "Please enter your second number"
    7
    "Please enter an operator"
    -
    "Result: -4"
    
A second example:

    "Please enter your first number"
    12
    "Please enter your second number"
    12
    "Please enter an operator"
    +
    "Result: 24"

Your calculator only needs to handle 3 user inputs: 2 `int`s and 1 operator. You may test an RPN calculator [here](http://www.abecedarical.com/javascript/script_reverse_polish.html).
