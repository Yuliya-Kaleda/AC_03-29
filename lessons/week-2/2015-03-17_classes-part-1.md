##### Thursday's lesson
- Creating our own classes
- References vs. values

### Object-oriented programming
Object-oriented programming is a style of computer programming in which the programmer represents the real world using "objects." An *object* is a very generic term in software development and will have different meanings depending on the context and language. For now, this definition is enough:

> *Definition:* An *object* is a group of primitive types, methods, and other objects.

Real-world objects have state and behavior. For example, a car has state (color, make, model) and behavior (turning, accelerating). Object-oriented programming is an attempt to model this combination of state and behavior in a modular, comprehensible way.

*Fig 1. A motorcycle, sedan, truck, and semi are all cars. They can be thought of as the same kind of object.*

##### Why use objects?
- Modularity: objects can be maintained independent of other objects in the system.
- Information-hiding: You can use an object without knowing how it is implemented!
- Code reuse: If an object already exists, you can just use it rather than creating it yourself.

### Classes
> *Definition:* A *class* is a blueprint for creating objects.

##### Why use classes?
